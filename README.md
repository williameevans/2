1. In the project that was submitted for module three, the task was to create a program that allowed it's users to view a 12 hour clock and a 24 hour clock on their website. 
2. I felt that one thing that I did well with this code is that it was short and simple to use. I felt that it approached the problem directly and wasn't particularly complex. It's functions/features felt well defined and easy to read. 
3. I feel that I could enhance my code by adding more features or styles to the code. While the code accomplishes the task, it could be more efficient and secure by adding more failsafes or styling options.
4. At the time, I found that the most challenging part of the project was creating the function with the branches for the user. Being able to create the different clocks was easy enough but the branch was difficult to make both an option I overcame this obstacle by reviewing the material in the textbook and with constant trial and error. As I reviewed material, I attempted to implement it into the code and test the code. When I was hitting a wall, I looked for examples of similar code and how they approached this. I found tools like youtube and stack overflow to be helpful.
5.  One skill that I found helpful was being able to create a program that allowed for two different types of clocks. This can be used for other projects that require two or more options in display. It can be used for other projects that require converting/altering existing data. For example, projects that make require different calendar formatting or temperatures. 
6. I felt that the program was readable because it was simple and short. It can be understood by others who know C++. It is adaptable because it is robust and can be altered to include other functions.
